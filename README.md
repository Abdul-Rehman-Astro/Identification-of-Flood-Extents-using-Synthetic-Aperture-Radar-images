# Identification-of-Flood-Extents-using-Synthetic-Aperture-Radar-images
• Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an all-weather, day-and-night satellite  observation technique to observe the earth’s surface processes as shown in  Figure 1.  • Flood is considered to be one of the major disasters causing huge losses to life  and property across the globe. In particular, floods occur in different parts of  India every year during the monsoon season.  • Our motivation in this work is to use SAR to identify flood extents and to assist in  emergency response operations. SAR is a useful tool for flood detection as it is  operational during cloud cover and rainfall to give information on flood extents
